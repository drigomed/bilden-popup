## 📌 Overview

**Bilden Popup** is a visual extension designed to enhance the user experience in Qlik Sense by allowing:

- Displaying contextual **help**, **instructions**, **tutorials**, **secondary panels**, **documentation**, or any other complementary material without leaving the current view.

- Customizing the button’s position, icon, label, and popup behavior.

- ✅ Option to load a **sheet** from the same app.
- ✅ Supports **fixed positioning** for the trigger button (top/right).
- ✅ Optional **selection bar** inside the popup.
- ✅ Support for custom icons on the trigger button.
- ✅ Compatible with **Qlik Cloud** and **Qlik Sense Client-Managed**.

Fixed position – the button is positioned according to the (top/right) settings:

Without fixed positioning (button appears inside the component area):
